What is a Message from the Mine?

"Messages from the Mines (MFTM) delves into and preserves unique messages inscribed forever in the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Within this decentralized Bitcoin record, one can discover concealed love notes, enigmatic verses, ASCII illustrations, personal signatures, tributes, and more. 
These inscriptions represent an inventive deviation from the standard Bitcoin transaction process, standing as digital artistry; they are distinct cultural relics immortalized in a cutting-edge digital platform. 
MFTM was originally an interactive art installation. This online version serves as an archive of the messages we extracted for the original project from January 2009 to April 2018. 
It is meant to be used by researchers, media archaeologists, and the general public"

Now What does this mean?

Imagine you're at a party, and someone hands you a note to read out loud. But instead of a simple message, the note has instructions that make you do something unexpected, like singing or dancing. If you follow the instructions, it means you didn't check the note properly before reading it.In the world of websites, there's a similar trick where people can "sneak in" unexpected instructions (or "code") for the website to follow. 

If the website follows these instructions without checking, it shows there's a weakness in the website's defenses. Someone found a clever way to hide these sneaky instructions in the record book of Bitcoin transactions (called the blockchain). If a website shows these transactions without checking them first, it might end up following the sneaky instructions. In this case, the sneaky instruction just popped up a message telling the website's visitor about the weakness. But in theory, it could have been something more harmful.

Since the warning was hidden in the Bitcoin record book, some websites that show these transactions realized they had this weakness and fixed it. The tricky part is that not only the current websites but also any new websites in the future need to be aware of this trick if they show Bitcoin transactions.Over time, many similar sneaky instructions have been hidden in the Bitcoin record book. If you ever hear about the "xss" tag, it's just a label for these types of sneaky instructions.

Inscribed in the Mines will utilize this basic code.

A Bitcoin Parser Software

Utilizing the Bitcoin Parser software, we delve deep into the annals of Bitcoin transactions, uncovering text-based messages artfully embedded within. Of the 520,000+ blocks available at the time, approximately 11,000 were found to contain intentionally inscribed textual data. This software serves as a tool, allowing us to sift through these messages, tag, and categorize them based on prevalent themes and repeated message styles. Our exploration doesn't stop there; we scour the internet to decipher some of the most enigmatic or captivating messages, enriching them with annotations, insights, and observations. Through our efforts, we've compiled an extensive dataset, featuring messages in over 50 diverse languages.

Each Inscribed Message Display consists of four key elements:

Message Panel: This section showcases messages sourced from the block you're observing. Text highlighted in blue originates directly from the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile, annotations or insights added to these messages are outlined in purple.

Timeline: This visual representation traces the timeline of messages inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The overarching purple graph denotes all messages, while the blue graph zeroes in on specific filters applied by the viewer. Beyond its illustrative purpose, this timeline aids in seamlessly navigating between message-containing blocks.

Block Information: Here, you'll be presented with fundamental details about the particular block you're exploring.

Search Utility: This is your gateway to explore the vast textual content extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain. Through a "fuzzy search" mechanism, you can sift through the content, using tags to delve into different languages, themes, and recurring message patterns that have been deciphered and categorized."

The Bitcoin Parser:

Detects outputs types
Detects addresses in outputs
Interprets scripts
Supports SegWit
Supports ordered block parsing

Will look into taproot integration as well as unitsat and xverse.
